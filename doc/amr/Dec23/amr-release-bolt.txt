# ::snt The Chinese military expenditures are soaring. By contrast, America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures, repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities.

# ::snt Early in the morning on September 1, my father, as usual, was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise. At Jiuli Street, he saw someone lying on the side of the road, and so, out of kindness, he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon. Then, three people ran up to him, kicking and beaing him (according to the police, they had drunk four cases of beer at the time). As a result, my father's skull suffered serious injury. He bled profusely and lost consciousness. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his pupils were already dilated. However, with prompt rescue given by a doctor, he survived. As there was serious bleeding, the doctor performed a life-saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father's head to remove blood clots. Due to profuse bleeding, some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain, putting his life in danger.

# ::snt Previously, due to issues about the high-rise buildings on Maoye's pre-sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well. Some were depressed, and some were irritated. In short, we felt very angry.

However, has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other. And at the end of the war of resistance, it then stirred up the civil war, and lured China to get involved in the Korean War. If Stalin was still alive, China would have more trouble!

Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls, it will be brought down from within the party itself. Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US: we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China, let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite, vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically, citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us.
