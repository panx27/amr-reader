# ::snt In hepatocellular carcinoma, biomarker analysis in Phase II clinical trials showed a clear correlation between levels of phospho-ERK and clinical response, suggesting that inhibition of Raf kinase is responsible for part of the clinical benefit (<ce:cross-ref id="crosref0365" refid="bib1">Abou-Alfa et al., 2006</ce:cross-ref>), but in the other indications, it appears likely that inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 or other kinases is responsible.
